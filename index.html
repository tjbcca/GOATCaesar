          Caesar was raised by Will Rodman after he discovered his enhanced
          mental ability passed onto him by his deceased mother, who was a test
          subject at GenSys labs. After being taken to an enrichment center by
          animal control, Caesar rebelled by sneaking out and stealing the same
          formula that made him intelligent and using it on his fellow apes. He
          led his people well, and always tried to coexist with humans, for Will
          was good to him. However, when forced to go to war Caesar was brave
          and even after being recaptured he devised a plan to free himself and
          his fellow apes. Even after his death, his legacy serves as a
          guideline for apes centuries in the future.

          <br />Caesar of course would not be what he is if not for the great
          Andy Serkis, who embodies Caesar and gives an impeccable performance.
          He received numerous nominations and awards, showing how impactful he
          was for the character.
