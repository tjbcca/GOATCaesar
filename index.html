          <br />Caesar was raised by Will Rodman after he discovered his
          enhanced mental ability passed onto him by his deceased mother, who
          was a test subject at GenSys labs. After being taken to an enrichment
          center by animal control, Caesar rebelled by sneaking out and stealing
          the same formula that made him intelligent and using it on his fellow
          apes. He led his people well, and always tried to coexist with humans,
          for Will was good to him. However, when forced to go to war Caesar was
          brave and even after being recaptured he devised a plan to free
          himself and his fellow apes. Even after his death, his legacy serves
          as a guideline for apes centuries in the future.

          Andy Serkis, who embodies Caesar and gives an impeccable performance.
          He received numerous nominations and awards, showing how impactful he
          was for the character.
